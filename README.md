## - Details of our data set - 

### * Downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data/
  
  - Contains NFL spread, over/under line, weather data, stadium names, and team scores for each NFL game between 09/02/1966 and 10/09/2023.

  
### * Final Data Set:
 
  - Removed all rows before 01/21/1979 as the data did not contain over/under predictions until Super Bowl XIII
    

### * Created New Columns:

  - Total Score (home team score + away team score)

  - Accuracy % ([total score / over under line prediction ] x 100)

  - Temperature Feel (group temperature data into 6 ranges)

  - Humidity Feel (group humidity in 5 ranges)


## Over/Under projection compared to total score of the game

  - How accurate was the over/under line in projecting the total score of a game?

  A correlation coefficient of 0.3 indicates a moderate positive relationship
  

## How do different weather conditions impact the total score and accuracy of the over/under line prediction?

## How does the humidity levels during a game impact the total score?

# Conclusions

  - The over/under line was the most accurate looking at the 2013-2022 decade of football and the least accurate during the 1993-2002 decade of football
  - The over/under line has become more accurate with time. This makes sense as they have more data to predict the over/under line and ensure its accuracy.
  - The correlation coefficient was fairly consistent around .3 with the exception of the 1993-2002 decade where it was .26

  - The only variables that we found to show a statistically significant relationship were the temperature and the total score. So of the variables we looked atâ€¦ temperature seems to have the highest impact on the total score of the game
  - All other variables we tested came up not statistically significant, meaning they had little to no impact on the total score of a game or the accuracy of the over/under line prediction.
